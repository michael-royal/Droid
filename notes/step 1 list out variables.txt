step 1: list out variables
step 2: initialize the voices array 
step 3: create a function to get the voice list
note: the voice list will not show unless a function called "onvoicechanged" is ran and equated to the function to fetch the voices

step 4: create options for the voices change select menu
step5: set two attributes for the options(data_lang and data_name

step6: make the function to activate the speech
step7: check if it is speaking using :synth.speaking:
step8: check if the textinput is empty  
step9: if the former is false then we create a new speechsythesisutterance () object to access the properties assigned to it specifically onend and onerror 
step10: selecting the voices from the list of voices to use for the speech  using the attribute and the index{0} 

step11:loop through the array of voices and check if the voice.name matches the selected voice if it does then equate the object you created.voice to the voice 

step12: submit the form and invoke the speak() function
